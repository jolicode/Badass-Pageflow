    "description" : "Allows to manage flows of pages: open a child window, go back to the parent window, close the current pageflow, move to a page by its index, etc. It is therefore comparable to a NavigationGroup, except it is cross-platform and it allows a greater personnalization. In particular, the Pageflow widget allows to translate in every direction, and not only on a horizontal path.",
